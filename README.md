# Welcome to my Homage homework

---

## The Brief

This is my final piece of homework from [The Jump's](https://www.thejump.tech/) CSS module on their full stack developer bootcamp course.

The brief was to recreate an existing homepage, which was to be as true to the original as possible. For this project I choose [NOWNESS.com](https://www.nowness.com/). The reason for my choice was that I felt it had a lot of different features that would further challenge my CSS knowledge and skills.

## The Build

We were given the freedom to build the site however we liked. I styled the site utilising SCSS. I used CSS Grid and Flexbox for the layout and a very small amount of Javascript for the dropdown menu.

## The Result

I feel the end result matches the brief given and I'm happy with the outcome.
